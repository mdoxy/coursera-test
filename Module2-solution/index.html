          <p class='description'>
            Barfi or burfi is a milk-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent with a fudge-like consistency.
            Its name comes from the Persian and Urdu word (barf) for snow. 
            Barfi is consumed throughout India and Pakistan and is especially popular in North India.
            It is often served at celebrations and religious festivals such as Diwali and Holi.
            Barfi originated in Persia and was introduced to India by the Mughal Empire in the 16th century.

          <p class='description'>
            The creator of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today,
            in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867). 
            It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.
            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
            It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat.
